full functionality should work now. I have not fully looked at the lab manual to see the full details of requirements. But my code accepts input from client, puts it into a struct and sends the struct to the server. The server receives the struct with the file name, checks for the file name within the file_server executable directory. If it is, the server will read the data in the file and store it into a the pdu.data. The pdu.data is sent to the client in packets of 100 bytes at a time, unless there less than 100 bytes to send. eg if the file size is 230 bytes, the server will send 230 / 100 = 2.3 (expressed as 2 given the arithmetic, so we add 1 to make it 3 total packets to send). The final packet will be sent with a 'F' struct.type. The client will continuously recvieve through the socket until it receives a struct.type of 'F'. while receiving struct, it will concatenate the struct.data into an array and use that array to create a file using that data.
